Analytics server

-Authentication to distinguish between the services
-Simple data analysis (how many messages, averages etc.)
-Search functions by keywords or date/time
-Data visualization (json for easy analysis, then optimized for python or something (or csv lol))
-User roles and access control (log in and sign up page with node server or so(or import html) (auth server-directory))
-sort Data,Logs andd warmings into different tables ect. have other logic for it

to test: Python script which simulates users (per second)

with docker as container(also for testing)

Goals:
-Use Env correctly and securely
-authentication with headers etc
-Make everything relatively secure
-Some front-end (dashboard)
-maybe https if you can do it locally
-kind of a client to use in custom applications to interface with the service/to authenticate services(for example rotating codes to sign up new services and so on)




LLM ideas:

1. Automated Testing Suite
Implement automated tests for your application to ensure reliability and catch bugs early. This could include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

# Example command to run tests in Go
go test ./... -v


3. Documentation Generation
Generate API documentation automatically using tools like Swagger or GoDoc. This ensures that your application is understandable and usable by others.

# Example command to generate GoDoc documentation
godoc -http=:6060

-Alerts
-OAuth
-Ensure data encryption at rest and in transit using TLS/SSL.
-Use tools like Apache JMeter or Locust for load testing.
